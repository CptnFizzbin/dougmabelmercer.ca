    "Thank you papa for all the help and support you've given me and David. Thank you for the wonderful winter holidays on that slide you built every winter at Lake St. Peter. Thanks for the Pontoon boating trips spent swimming in the lake. Thanks for the trip to Newfoundland to see the Bay of Fundy. Thanks for the weekends spent in Kitchener at your condo. Thanks for the laughs, and your sense of humor.",
    "Papa, I'm going to miss you."

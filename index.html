                    Mabel’s life-long companion, Douglas will miss the love and friendship they shared for more than 65
                    years. Mabel is survived by her children, Paul, James (Cinda) and Susan (Michael); grandchildren,
                    Riley, Stephen, David and Savannah; and by her brother Raymond. She is predeceased by her brother
                    Douglas
                    (Anne). She will be greatly missed by her many in-laws, nieces, nephews and cousins; friends and
                    family in Kitchener and Bancroft, Ontario, and those down home in Harbour Grace and Upper Island
                    Cove,
                    Newfoundland.

                    Mabel and Douglas raised many foster-children in the early years of the marriage in the late 1960’s
                    and early 1970’s. Mabel worked at Electrohome, MTD and she retired from Colonial Cookies. Mabel was
                    a talented seamstress and helped to make uniforms for the Ventures All-Girl Drum and Bugle Corps.
                    She and Doug spent many a summer travelling in support of the Drum Corps. Mabel was a Beaver Leader
                    and a school volunteer. She will be remembered for her commitment to her various church families
                    including Holy Trinity, Kitchener and Holy Trinity, Maynooth. Mabel and Douglas travelled
                    extensively with their young children and then their grandchildren, especially enjoying camping in
                    their fifth wheel. They travelled by land to Newfoundland, Calgary and across to Alaska, and even
                    flew as far as Dubai and Kenya.

                    Thank you papa for all the help and support you've given me and David. Thank you for the wonderful
                    winter holidays on that slide you built every winter at Lake St. Peter. Thanks for the Pontoon
                    boating trips spent swimming in the lake. Thanks for the trip to Newfoundland to see the Bay of
                    Fundy. Thanks for the weekends spent in Kitchener at your condo. Thanks for the laughs, and your
                    sense of humor.

                    Uncle Doug, Paul, James and Susan.....our thoughts are with you all. Aunt Mabel was always a joy and
                    always extremely welcoming in every aspect, whether she was sharing her possessions or her time. We
                    are
                    grateful for the laughs shared and will think of her often with great fondness.

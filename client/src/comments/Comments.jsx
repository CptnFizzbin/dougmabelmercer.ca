                    Thank you papa for all the help and support you've given me and David. Thank you for the wonderful
                    winter holidays on that slide you built every winter at Lake St. Peter. Thanks for the Pontoon
                    boating trips spent swimming in the lake. Thanks for the trip to Newfoundland to see the Bay of
                    Fundy. Thanks for the weekends spent in Kitchener at your condo. Thanks for the laughs, and your
                    sense of humor.

                    Papa, I'm going to miss you.

                    So sorry to hear of Mabel's passing. May she rest in peace and know the glory of God. An elegant and

                    Uncle Doug, Paul, James and Susan.....our thoughts are with you all. Aunt Mabel was always a joy and
                    always extremely welcoming in every aspect, whether she was sharing her possessions or her time. We
                    are
                    grateful for the laughs shared and will think of her often with great fondness.

                Mabel and Douglas raised many foster-children in the early years of the marriage in the late 1960’s
                and early 1970’s. Mabel worked at Electrohome, MTD and she retired from Colonial Cookies. Mabel was
                a talented seamstress and helped to make uniforms for the Ventures All-Girl Drum and Bugle Corps.
                She and Doug spent many a summer travelling in support of the Drum Corps. Mabel was a Beaver Leader
                and a school volunteer. She will be remembered for her commitment to her various church families
                including Holy Trinity, Kitchener and Holy Trinity, Maynooth. Mabel and Douglas travelled
                extensively with their young children and then their grandchildren, especially enjoying camping in
                their fifth wheel. They travelled by land to Newfoundland, Calgary and across to Alaska, and even
                flew as far as Dubai and Kenya.
